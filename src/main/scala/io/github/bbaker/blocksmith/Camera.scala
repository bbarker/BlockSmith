/**
  * Camera manages a first person camera in 3D space. It calculates the necessary
  * matrix transformations to orient the camera, and provides a simplified
  * mechanism for orienting the camera via movement and rotation methods. It makes
  * heavy use of the Vector class.
  * <p>
  * Camera is meant to be used with OpenGL, which uses a right-handed system.
  * Camera, however, creates a transparent layer between this and functions as
  * if it was using a left-handed coordinate system (into the screen being
  * positive Z rather than negative). GameState uses a left-handed system in the
  * sense that objects only exist in positive coordinates extending forward, up
  * and right from the origin. This is by virtue of the fact that coordinates of
  * objects (which are integers) are simply stored as indices in a 3D array.
  * Because Camera's methods cater to the state's system, Camera is a part of the
  * model (MVC), not the view. This decision was made through the logic that
  * Camera represents a property of the Player (its view) rather than an aspect
  * of rendering. Internally, however, Camera is more of a mix of the model and
  * the view.
